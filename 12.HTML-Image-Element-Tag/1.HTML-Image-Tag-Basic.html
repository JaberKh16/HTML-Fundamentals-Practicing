    HTML Image Adding Tag: <img> .... </img>
    =========================================
    Images are basically the binary files which can be come in many formats
    such as: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gifs etc

    To add a image using <img> ... </img> source of the needs to be provided.
    Now, though the image is a file so the source can be following type:
        1) File on the device
        2) File on the USB
        3) URL Of the File
    
    To locate that file two concepts has been used which are the following:
        a) Absoulte Path:   Actual Path/address of the file which can be accesible 
                            anywhere located on local machine or url.
        b) Relative Path:   Usually the path which can be access from parent directory 
                            path located on local machine.
    
    Depending on the OS type these path is varried like following:
    
    a) On Absolute Path:
        1) If Windows OS then use-  file:///driver_name\Folder_name\file_name.ext
        2) If Linux/Mac OS then use- /folder_name/file_name.ext
    
    b) On Relative Path:
    
        1) If Windows/Linux/Mac OS then use- Use relative path with forward slash(/).To differentiate
                                            between parent path(../) or current_path(./)

    Image Tag has some Attributes along with it to manipulate the image
    which are the following:
    1) src = "path_value"       ; to include file absolute/relative path.
    2) width = "numeric_value"  ; to control the width of the image.
    3) height = "numeric_value" ; to control the height of the image.
    4) title="string_value"     ; title when mouse hover on that image.
    5) alt= "string_value"      ; displayed alternative content only when image isn't available/found.
    6) border ="numeric_value"  ; to include border on top of the image.
    7) hspace = "numeric_value" ; to include a horizontal distance between images.
    8) vspace = "numeric_value" ; to include a vertical distance between images.
