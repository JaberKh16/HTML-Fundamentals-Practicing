    ===================================================
    HTML Section Element Tag basic purpose of use is to sectioning 
    different partition of article or paragraph into some sections.
    Normally, most of the HTML Developer use block level element tag(div)
    to make blocks and then label them using class or id attribute to 
    differentiate among them. So, HTML5 provides Semantic Element Tags
    which serves the same purpose.
