    HTML Video Tag: <video> .... </video>
    =====================================
    HTML <video> ... </video> is used to include video in a HTML
    Page. Just need to include a <source> .... </source> tag where the 
    video file - src="path" to define which file to look for when 
    playing the video. Now, The source file(src) can be either internal
    saved on local machine or maybe a file url from web page.

    HTML <video> ... </video> tag has some attributes to work with
    the video controlling which are the following:
        a) width    = "numeric_value"   ; used to set the width of the video player.
        b) height   = "numeric_value"   ; used to set the height of the video player.
        c) control                      ; to control the video options visible(such as play, pause, zoom etc).
        d) muted                        ; to set the video volume set to Zero.
        e) loop                         ; to set loop on the video.
        f) autoplay                     ; to set a autoplay on the video so when video played finised it gets autoplay.
        g) poster                       ; to set a poster on the video. Take an image path to set.
