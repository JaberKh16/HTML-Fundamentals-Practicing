<!--
    HTML Track Tag Basic:<track>....</track>
    ========================================
    <track>...</track> tag is used define a text track for  media element like- audio or video tags. 
    This element is used to define a subtitles, caption files or other type of files containing text 
    that should be visible when the media content is playing. Tracks are formatted in two formats such
    as - (.webvtt or .vtt) usually.

    <audio> and <video> might make use of <track> since each media format sometimes has need of other 
    supporting files, such as subtitles or multiple channels of information.

    As such, <audio> or <video> will always be parents of a <track> element. Now the <track> tag takes 
    the following attributes.

        ● 'default' defines a default track unless overridden by user settings. It takes no additional value.

        ● 'kind' defines text tracks, and has the values of captions, chapters, descriptions, metadata and subtitles.

        ● 'label' takes text as its attribute and defines a name for a text track.

        ● 'src' is required, since <track> has to refer to some other media file. Its value is the URL of the 
          resource to be accessed.

        ● 'srclang' defines that language of any text tracks and is also required for kind=“subtitle”.
    
    For Example-

        <video width="512" height="288" controls>
            <source src="watchVideo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
