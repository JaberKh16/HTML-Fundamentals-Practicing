    HTML5 Feature - favicon Basic
    =============================
    A favicon is the little image icon that you typically see in the browser tab next to the title. 
    This can be any image format (.jpg, .png, .gif etc.) but the .ico format has caught on as being 
    very popular for favicons.

    Can place the favicon image in the root directory (same area as your index.html file) and then need 
    to explicitly <link> to it in the <head> section. Here are two examples for linking to favicons.
    One is a jpeg file and the other an ico file.

    For Example-

        1) <link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico"/>
        2) <link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/jpeg" href="favicon.jpg"/>

    Recall that "type" refers to that hundreds of official Media Types mentioned earlier, and so have to  
    specify the formal code for your chosen media type.

    The ".ico" format has the Media Type designation of 'image/x-icon' (which you would never know without 
    looking it up online!). 
    
    rel=“shortcut icon” defines this file as an icon so that it can be used to complement the 
    page’s <title> in the various functions that titles partake in, such as browser tab display 
    and saved coursemarks.
