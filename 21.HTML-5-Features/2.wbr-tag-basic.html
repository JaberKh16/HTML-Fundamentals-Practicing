    HTML Word Break Tag: <wbr>...</wbr> Tag Basic
    ==============================================
    <wbr>...</wbr> tag stands for ‘word break opportunity’ and is used typically for very long words that may 
    need to be interrupted by formatting in the browser display. Like its cousin <br> it is a self-closing tag. 
    It should be inserted in the places where you might hyphenate a word as it is split to go to a new line. 
    It produces no visual effect other than giving the browser some explicit instructions as to where there 
    are good places to break up words and continue them on the next line.

        The longest word in the German language is <em>Donaudampf<wbr>schiffahrt<wbr>sgesell<wbr>schaft    
        skapitän<wbr></em> and consists of 42 characters! It totally needs wbr tags.
