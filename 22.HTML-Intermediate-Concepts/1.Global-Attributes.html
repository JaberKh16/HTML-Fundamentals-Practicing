    HTML Global Attributes Basic Concepts
    =====================================
    In the presentations of the HTML tags above, the attributes specific to each tag have been presented 
    and described. There is also a set of attributes called Global Attributes which apply to all HTML tags. 
    Feel free to use them with any HTML tag, because they are globally available to all of them!
    
    Those attributes are the following-

    ● "accesskey" ==>   this provides shortcuts for activating elements or bringing them into focus. 
                        One activates the shortcut key differently depending on the browser. 
                        In Chrome, it is alt + the accesskey which brings the element into focus, 
                        but in Firefox, it is shift + alt + the accesskey.

   
    For Example-
        <a href="https://someURLlink..." accesskey="z">In Chrome, focus the element w/ alt+z</a><br>
       
   

    Setting up keyboard shortcuts to HTML elements to focus them

    ● "autocapitalize" ==>  gives control capitalization over text input that is received from devices other 
                            than physical keyboards, e.g. voice or mobile based text inputs. 
                            Its values are:

                                - off or none no capitalization is applied.

                                - on or sentences will capitalize the first letter of a sentence.

                                - words the first letter of every word will be capitalized.

                                - characters all letters will be in uppercase.

    ● "class" ==>   class names can be assigned to any elements to show that they have a special function that applies 
                    to more than one of them. The main uses of the class attribute are to reference a group HTML 
                    elements in a stylesheet, or to manipulate them with JavaScript.

    ● "contenteditable" ==> clarifies whether an element can be edited or not. It takes the values true or false.
                            Content that is editable can be changed in the webpage.

    ● data-* ==>    stores customized data that is private to the web page or an application. In the course 
                    of our website project, we may wish to create our own custom data labels, hierarchies 
                    or classification schemes, to be used by Js or CSS scripts, 
                    For example-

                        <h1 data-song-genre="hiphop">Dear Mama</h1>
                        <h1 data-song-genre="edm">Levels</h1>
                        <h1 data-song-genre="folkrock">Like a Rolling Stone</h1>


                    An example of giving customized data to HTML elements, which can be used by JavaScript or CSS.

    ● "dir" ==>     gives the direction of text progression for an element with textual content. The three values dir t
                    akes are ltr (left-to-right), rtl (right-to-left) and auto (let the browser decide). 
                    This is illustrated above in the section on the <bdo> tag.

    ● "draggable" ==>   Have you ever tried to drag a photo from a website onto your desktop and found out that 
                        you couldn’t? This attribute controls whether or not an element is draggable and takes 
                        as its values true or false. In the example below, you will not be able to drag the 
                        image from a web page onto your computer’s desktop.
                        For Example-

                            <img src="http://bit.ly/33y4EuS" width="300" height="300" alt="city" draggable="false">


    ● "dropzone" ==>    a new global attribute and is not currently supported by most browsers. It indicates 
                        the kinds of content that can be dropped onto an element and uses the HTML Drag 
                        and Drop API. It takes the values move, copy or link.

    ● "hidden" ==>  controls the visibility and relevance of an element. It can keep content from being 
                    displayed until some condition is met in Js which can then remove this attribute and 
                    make the element visible. It takes no value other than itself.

    ● "id" ==>  this provides unique identifiers to elements that are a special case of some kind. These 
                identifiers can be utilized by Js or CSS for interaction or stylization purposes or 
                used by in-page anchors for internal navigation on the same page. The value is a unique name.

    ● "inputmode" ==>   Allows for inputs to be designed that are optimized for certain kinds of data entry. 
                        Its possible values are:

                        - none used when the page has its own keyboard feature.
                        - text is the default for receiving keyboard-based data.
                        - decimal includes number formatting for decimals and large numbers by providing 
                          periods and commas.
                        - numeric expects data from a numerical entry keypad, with numbers ranging 0-9.
                        - tel optimizes data entry for phone numbers, including characters for * , # and -
                        - search optimizes data for performing a search function.
                        - email formatting includes the character @ to helps with entering emails.
                        - url is optimized for web addresses and includes http and domain elements built in.

    ● "itemprop"  ==>   Allows you to add unique item properties to an element of your own devising, 
                        similar to id and class.
                        For Example-

                            <h1 itemprop="Vietnamese">Pho</h1>

                        There isn’t any visual change with using itemprop, but this attribute allows code to 
                        search out custom properties given to HTML elements.

    ● "lang" ==> indicates an element’s language the two-letter language codes.

    ● "spellcheck" ==> specifies whether or not an element’s spelling and grammar should be checked




    ● "style" ==>   provides a place for inline CSS styling within the tag. 
                    For Example-

                        <tag style=“property:value; property:value; property:value”>

    ● "tabindex" ==>    gives an element’s tabbing order. This allows users to tab quickly through a site's tabbale
                        content, using the keyboard’s tab key. For example, you might want a user to tab through
                        items on a form, or across images to select them. It takes the value of 
                        the tabbing order, e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4 etc.

    ● "title" ==>   provides additional information about an element that may be relevant and will display a popup 
                    box when the cursor moves over it. One of its most common uses is to provide tips or help 
                    comments over items as the user expresses interest in them by placing the cursor over it.

    ● "translate" ==>   indicates whether an element should be subject to translation or not, and delivers 
                        this information to the browser by taking values of yes or no.
