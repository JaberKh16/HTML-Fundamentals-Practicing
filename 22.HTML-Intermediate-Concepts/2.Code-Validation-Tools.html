            ● Code validation is the process of having your code checked for errors and deviations from the standard. There are online tools you can use to check your HTML code for any problem areas.

            ● These services can be found via a simple search engine return on “HTML code validator.” Some code validators ask you to upload an HTML file or paste in the HTML code. 
              Others accept the URL of the live website and can check your code from its presence on the web.

            ● A code validation result will seek out potential problem areas in your code and indicate these as either <b>Warnings</b> or <b>Errors</b>, depending on the severity of the code wobbliness.

            ● Also, the message will indicate the exact line and column of the code where the error can be found, or the range of lines where the wobbliness is propagating.
