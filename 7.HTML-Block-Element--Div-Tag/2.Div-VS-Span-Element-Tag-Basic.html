<!--HTML Div and Span Tag
    =======================
    Div Tag: <div> .... </div>  is generally used to make a Block Level
    Element(means element in a block element will be started from 
    next line as a block) where block level element work with multiple
    similar type content and change the behaviour of those content.
    
    Span Tag: <span> .... </span> is used to create a Inline Level Element
    where 'span' is used to change a small chunks of any content.

            Experimental evidence shows that the bond angle is 104.5°, not 90°. 
            The prediction of the valence bond theory model does not match the 
            real-world observations of a water molecule; a different model is needed. 
            Quantum-mechanical calculations suggest why the observed bond angles in H2O 
            differ from those predicted by the overlap of the 1s orbital of the hydrogen 
            atoms with the 2p orbitals of the oxygen atom. 
            
            The mathematical expression known as the wave function, ψ, contains information 
            about each orbital and the wavelike properties of electrons in an isolated atom. 
            <b>When atoms are bound together in a molecule, the wave functions combine to 
            produce new mathematical descriptions that have different shapes. This process of 
            combining the wave functions for atomic orbitals is called hybridization and is 
            mathematically accomplished by the linear combination of atomic orbitals, 
            LCAO, (a technique that we will encounter again later).</b> 
            
            The new orbitals that result are called hybrid orbitals. The valence orbitals in an 
            isolated oxygen atom are a 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals. The valence orbitals in 
            an oxygen atom in a water molecule differ; they consist of four equivalent hybrid 
            orbitals that point approximately toward the corners of a tetrahedron (Figure 2).
            <br><br> Consequently, the overlap of the O and H orbitals should result in a 
            tetrahedral bond angle (109.5°). The observed angle of 104.5° is experimental 
            evidence for which quantum-mechanical calculations give a useful 
            explanation: Valence bond theory must include a hybridization component to give 
            accurate predictions.

        <p> Thinking in terms of overlapping atomic orbitals is one way for us to explain how 
            chemical bonds form in diatomic molecules. However, to understand how molecules 
            with more than two atoms form stable bonds, we require a more detailed model. 
            As an example, let us consider the water molecule, in which we have one oxygen atom 
            bonding to two hydrogen atoms. <span style="color: #a5a521;">Oxygen has the electron 
            configuration 1s22s22p4, with two unpaired electrons (one in each of the two 2p orbitals). 
            Valence bond theory would predict that the two O–H bonds form from the overlap of these 
            two 2p orbitals with the 1s orbitals of the </span> hydrogen atoms. 
            
            If this were the case, the bond angle would be 90°, as shown in Figure 1, because p orbitals 
            are perpendicular to each other.
