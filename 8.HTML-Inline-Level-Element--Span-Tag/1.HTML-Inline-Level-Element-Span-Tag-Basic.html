    ==============================================
    Definition:
    <span> .... </span> is generally called Inline Level Element
    where it is served the same purpose of grouping similar type of
    multiple contents as whole works as container like Block Level
    Element('div' tag), but unlike 'div' it changes the behaviour/state 
    of some part of those contents inside the container to make a distinct
    change with the rest.
    
    Effect of 'span': 
    'span' tage itself doesn't have any effect on its elements/contents
    unless stylying is being performed. There has no break line capability 
    with 'span' though it name suggest its a inline element.
    
    Use of 'span':
    As said 'span' is mainly used to make a small chunks of changes of contents
    inside this container. But it has two major use which are the following:
    
        1) For Styling Particular Content(when styling needs to perform use 'Class' Attribute)
        2) For Manupulation Of Particular Content (when manupulation needs to perform use 'id' Attribute)
